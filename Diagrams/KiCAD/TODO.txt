remove it from the diagram.

============================
[ ] Pull-up resistors need to be added to board.

[x] The sockets for the shift register ICs are the wrong size!
They are 14-pin sockets. The ICs are 16-pin. Current sockets
need to be removed and replaced with 16-pin types. After
replacement, the PCB pin IDs will need to be updated in the
schematic.
