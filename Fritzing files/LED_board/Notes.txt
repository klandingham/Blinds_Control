Measurements of LED pushbuttons at desired brightnesses.

Drop resistor calculations: Vsupply - Vled / Iled

        Voltage Drop    Forward Current     Drop Resistor (@ 12V)
Blue      0.1 V              0.1 mA             100K
Green     1.9 V              2.4 mA             4K3
Red       1.7 V              0.15 mA            68K

Blue LED to be controlled by D1, but inverted. See Fritzing schematic
in this folder. D1 is to be NORMALLY HIGH, flash by setting it LOW
periodically (invert current logic).
