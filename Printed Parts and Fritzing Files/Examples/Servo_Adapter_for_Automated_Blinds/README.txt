# Summary

This part is an adapter that mounts to a standard HiTec round servo horn.  The adapter interfaces with the hexagonal rod within the blinds to allow the servo to drive the opening and closing of the blind slats.  For reference purposes, the blinds I'm using are off-the-shelf Home Depot 2" faux wood.  Note that will also need some sort of mount/spacer to align the servo with the rod and to keep the servo from moving within the top rail of the blinds.

Print with 100% infill for strength.  I used (4) 2-56 screws to act as studs in the servo horn (drill out the (4) holes with a 1/16" drill).  The screws I used were 1/2" long; definitely too long but happened to be what I had on-hand.  Install the screws in the horn, mount the horn to the servo and then install the adapter.

I'm controlling the blinds using an Arduino and the mysensors plug-in (mysensors.org).

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: Makerfarm 12
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: Printed at .2mm height with a .4mm nozzle
Infill: 100%

Notes: 
I printed with support to form the pocket that goes over the servo mounting screw.  That said, it's probably a small enough area that it could be bridged without issue.
