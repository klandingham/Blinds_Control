Development Notes for Automatic Window Blinds

Version 0.1 - Servo motor solution - abandoned due to test servo motor
shorting out after only minimal testing. Decided these servos are not reliable
enough. Going back to a stepper motor approach.

==============================================================================


==============================================================================
STATUS: Just finished speed selection test sketch. Varies servo value across
a fixed array of values via pushbutton presses. Noted that pb needs real
debouncing! (see Debounce example).
==============================================================================
==============================================================================
NEXT TASK:

Modify the speed selection sketch to use one "medium" speed value. Change the
button logic to switch a transistor - see if I can turn the servo on/off via
the button.
Need to find a suitable transistor (test manually with the speed selection
sketch running on high speed).

==============================================================================


Decided to use servo motors instead of steppers. Will use clutch assemblies
already printed, driven directly by motors. Will need to design and print
a new base part that can attach to one of the horns supplied with the servo.

Current operation design:
	3 pushbuttons:
		1 - servo selection
		2 - close button
		3 - open button

Open/close buttons will operate on timeout:
	close button pushed:
		wait 1 second
		if close button still pushed
			move in close direction until close button released
		else
			send measured close
	open button pushed:
		wait 1 second
		if open button still pushed
			zero out open interval for all enabled servos
			move in open direction until open button released
			on release save measured interval for enabled servos
		else
			send measured open

DONE: ServoDutyCycle.ino varies duty cycle (DC) to servo using potentiometer.
Need to add serial output to show DC values as I adjust the pot. Then pick
one or two DC values each for forward/reverse and save these for the final
sketch. 8/13 update: after experimentation with this sketch, found that only
a few values were usable for the blinds project. Here are the speeds and
values (as args to analogWrite() in the sketch) I found:

	fast CCW = 67 to 68
	med  CCW = 69 to 70
	slow CCW = 71 to 72
	stop     = 73 to 76 (will probably disable trasistors instead)
	slow  CW = 77 to 78
	med   CW = 79 to 80
	fast  CW = 81 to 82

TODO: Write a "speed select" test to see if I can cycle through each
of these fixed speed values by repeatedly pressing a button.


Servo Switching Transistors:
Measured SM-S4306 servo under load: min 0.5 A xsistors should handle the
current.

DONE: Want to enable/disable each servo by switching power to each using a
control transistor. Need to measure current draw (under load) of servo in
both directions to determine current requirements that will be required
of these transistors.

TODO: Need to come up with code that will allow enabling of servos using
repetitive presses of a single selection button. Will need to step through
each combination, something like:

	0 0 0 (all disabled)
	0 0 1 (1 enabled)
	0 1 0 (2 enabled)
	1 0 0 (2 enabled)
	0 1 1 (1,2 enabled)
	1 1 0 (2,3 enabled)
	1 0 1 (1,3 enabled)
	1 1 1 (all enabled)
